    "1.In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition arises, Python raises an exception, which is a special object that represents the error or problem. Exception handling is a mechanism that allows you to deal with these exceptional conditions gracefully, rather than allowing them to crash your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Errors in your code (e.g., dividing by zero, accessing a non-existent variable).\n",
    "-External factors (e.g., file not found, network connection issues).\n",
    "-User interactions (e.g., user entering invalid data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python are typically represented by classes, and there is a hierarchy of exception classes. The base class for all exceptions is BaseException, but more specific exception classes inherit from it, such as Exception, ValueError, TypeError, and many others. You can catch and handle exceptions using try-except blocks in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program.\n",
    "-They are caused by logical errors or external factors like invalid user input or file operations.\n",
    "-Exceptions are represented by classes and can be caught and handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "-Your program may continue to execute after handling an exception, depending on your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Syntax errors occur during the parsing phase before the program is executed.\n",
    "-They are caused by violations of the language's syntax rules. Common examples include missing colons, unmatched parentheses,   or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "-Syntax errors prevent the program from running. The code won't execute until the syntax errors are fixed.\n",
    "-Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a Python program and can be handled at runtime, while syntax errors are errors in the code's structure and will prevent the program from running until they are fixed."
